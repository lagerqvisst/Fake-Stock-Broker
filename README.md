Project to learn Blazor

First draft. User can search and get stocks returned through Yahoo Finance API (https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/get_v1_indicators_rsi__stockticker)
Prices are currently set to the previous closing price of the stock (real-time is premium API). 
Users select the quantity of the stock they want to buy. If they have sufficent funds, it will be added to their portfolio.
Planning to add SQL authentication and more attributes showing the yield in % and absolutes for stocks and overall portfolio. 
Also Weighted Average Cost for a stock since a user can purchase a stock and different prices.
